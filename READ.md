# Welcome to Spaceman. A friendlier, less morbid version of the classic game "hangman." There is a randomly generated "secret word" that you will discover, through trial and error, by guessing one word at a time until you've hit your maximum allowed guess count or guessed the word and won the game! You will have 7 incorrect guesses, please enter a one letter guess per round! Have fun!

# To play: simply open open up your terminal window and run $ python3 ./spaceman.py
